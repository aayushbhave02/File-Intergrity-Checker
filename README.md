Project Title: File Integrity Checker Using Python
-Project Description:
This project implements a File Integrity Checker tool using Python. Its primary purpose is to track changes to important files and detect tampering or corruption, which is crucial in cybersecurity for ensuring data integrity.

The tool uses SHA-256 hashing to create unique digital fingerprints of files. It can store the current state of files and later verify if theyâ€™ve been modified, deleted, or remain unchanged. It works in two modes:

Store: Saves the hash values of the selected files.

Check: Compares the current hashes with the saved ones to detect changes.

This project introduces students to hashing algorithms, file handling, and integrity verification, which are essential topics in cybersecurity.
